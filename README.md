# Android Lab 2
**Software Design & Development**

Intents and Event Handling.

The [Instructions](Lab2_Intents.pdf) will guide you through the lab.


Recap on `git` commands:

`git clone url` copies an online (remote) repository to your machine

`git branch` displays your branches, and which one you're on

`git checkout branchname` switches to an existing branch

`git checkout -b branchname` creates a **new** branch, and switches to it

`git status` will show you which files are add/changed/deleted

`git add .` adds all changed files to the ready-to-commit stage

`git commit -m "message"` commits all staged files

`git push origin branchname` pushes all new commits to the remote repository

### Saving your work:
`git add .` stages all your changes

`git commit -m "work in progress"` saves your changes

`git push origin branchname` uploads your changes to the remote repository

### Continuing your work
If you are working on a different computer:
- `git clone url` to clone the repository fresh
- `git pull` to update an existing repository that is out of date

`git checkout branchname` to switch to your existing branch 
(note we are __not__ using `-b` in this command)

Continue where you left off.
